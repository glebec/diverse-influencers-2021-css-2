# Diverse Influencers 2021: CSS II

Responsive Design with Bootstrap

## Instructions

### Setup

-   Download this repository
-   Open this folder in your editor, e.g. VS Code
-   Separately, open `src/index.html` in a web browser
-   Edit and save the files in the `src` folder
-   Refresh your browser to see changes

### Exercise

Get started with this concrete task.

-   Your task is to re-create a layout **similar to** the one at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/carousel/. Don't worry about reproducing everything exactly!
-   Your layout should be **responsive**, with different layout for at least _two screen widths_ (e.g. small and large). You can choose precisely how the design should adapt; the example page supports many more widths than we are asking for.
-   HTML is provided. You don't *need* to modify the HTML at all except to add CSS classes, though you *may* change things if you like.
-   Add Bootstrap classes to the HTML to modify the design (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0). Also define custom classes in `styles.css` and add them to the HTML for any customization which Bootstrap doesn't support.

### Continuing Onwards

These are more open-ended goals for you to continue practicing.

-   See more examples at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/ for inspiration.
-   Take a look at the components at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0 (e.g. Forms, Button group, Card).
-   Add more HTML + CSS to your page, using Bootstrap classes to make your content look presentable.
-   Create a second page for this site, with different content and design, and use Bootstrap to implement a responsive layout.
